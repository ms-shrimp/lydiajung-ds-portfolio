# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Lydia Jung's Portfolio

---

I'm a recent graduate with a degree in **Data Science**, driven by a passion for uncovering insights that drive real-world decisions. My interests lie at the intersection of **data science** and **business strategy** using data not just to analyze, but to understand, communicate, and act.

This portfolio includes both technical projects and business-oriented presentations. Some projects are built with code, while others are slide decks that emphasize insight, storytelling, and strategic thinking.

Thanks for stopping by! Whether it's through data-driven research or strategic modeling, I'm always excited to explore how numbers can tell stories and guide better decisions.
